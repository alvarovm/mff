Mapped potential calculator
===========================

A mapped potential is a tabulated 2- or 3-body interatomic potential created from a Gaussian process using a 2- or 3-body kernel.
To use a mapped potential created with this python package within the ASE environment, it is necessary to setup a calculator using the ``m_ff.calculators`` class.
